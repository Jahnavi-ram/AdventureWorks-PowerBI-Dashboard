LinkedIn Post: Power BI Project â€“ AdventureWorks Dashboard
ðŸš€ Applying Power BI to Drive Business Insights ðŸ“Š

As part of my continuous learning journey, I worked on this interactive Power BI dashboard for AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company. This project, inspired by a hands-on case study from a Power BI course by Maven Analytics, allowed me to apply real-world business intelligence skillsâ€”transforming raw data into meaningful insights.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features of the Dashboard:
âœ… Revenue & Profit Analysis: Interactive KPIs tracking $24.9M revenue & $10.5M profit
âœ… Trend Analysis: Weekly revenue growth with forecasting insights
âœ… Product Performance: Top-selling & most-returned products
âœ… Customer Segmentation: Orders by income level & occupation
âœ… Geographic Analysis: Performance by region

ðŸ’¡ Why This Project Matters?

Beyond the course: Focused on real-world data storytelling & strategic insights
Advanced Power BI techniques: DAX calculations, data modeling & drill-downs
Business decision impact: Designed KPIs to align with executive-level reporting
Power BI isnâ€™t just about dashboardsâ€”itâ€™s about driving business decisions with data!
